Please note that all Sim Futures plans include a consistency requirement that traders must follow. The
consistency score ensures traders achieve their profit targets through steady, consistent trading rather
than relying on a few lucky trades. It encourages disciplined trading behavior and discourages risky or
&quot;YOLO&quot; style trading.
The consistency score is calculated using the following formula:
Consistency Score (%) = (Best Trading Day PnL / Total PnL) x 100
 A lower consistency score indicates profits are evenly distributed across multiple trading
days, reflecting more consistent trading behavior.
 A higher consistency score suggests profits are concentrated within fewer trading days,
indicating less consistency.
For example, a consistency requirement of 25% typically means you cannot reach your entire profit
target or request a withdrawal in fewer than four trading days (since 100% ÷ 25% = 4).
You must meet the consistency requirement to advance to the next phase or to become eligible for
withdrawals.

Examples:
•On a 100k account, say the profit target is $8k for example. If you make $2k for each of 4 days, you
would be meeting the consistency rule (best day of 2k / total pnl of 8k = 25%).
•On a 100k account, say the profit target is $8k for example. If you make $3k, $1k, $2k, $2k across 4
days, you would be violating the consistency rule (best day of 3k / total pnl of 8k = 37.5%). In order to
hit the profit target now, the account must reach a total profit of best day ($3k) / consistency (25%) =
$12k, while keep the &quot;best day&quot; at or below $3k.

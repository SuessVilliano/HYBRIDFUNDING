TRADING RULES | FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ):

ONE STEP OVERVIEW
April 2024

What is the difference between a Hard Breach and Soft Breach rule?
● Soft breach means that we will close all trades that have violated the rule. However, you can continue
trading in your Assessment or Funded Account.
● Hard breach means that you violated either the Daily Loss Limit or Max Trailing Drawdown rule. Both
rules constitute a hard breach. In the event you have a hard breach, you will fail the Assessment or have
your Funded Account taken away.
How do you calculate the Daily Loss Limit?
The Daily Loss Limit is the maximum your account can lose in any given day. Daily Loss Limit is calculated
using the previous day balance which resets at 5 PM EST. The Daily Stop compounds with the increase in
your account.
Example: if your prior day's end of day balance (5pm EST) was $100,000, your account would violate the
daily stop loss limit if your equity reached $95,000 during the day. If your floating equity is +$5,000 on a
$100,000 account, your new- day (5pm EST) max loss is based on your balance from the previous day
($100,000). So, your daily loss limit would still be $95,000.
How do you calculate the Maximum Trailing Drawdown?
The Maximum Trailing Drawdown is initially set at 6% and trails (using CLOSED BALANCE - NOT equity)
your account until you have achieved a 6% return in your account. Once you have achieved a 6% return
the Maximum Trailing Drawdown no longer trails and is permanently locked in at your starting balance.
Example: If your starting balance is $100,000, you can drawdown to $94,000 before you would violate
the Maximum Trailing Drawdown rule. Then for example let's say you take your account to $102,000 in
CLOSED BALANCE. This is your new high-water mark, which would mean your new Maximum Trailing
Drawdown would be $96,000. Next, let's say you take your account to $106,000 in CLOSED BALANCE,
which would be your new high-water mark. At this point your Maximum Trailing Drawdown would be
locked in at your starting balance of $100,000. So, regardless of how high your account goes, you would
only breach this rule if your account drew back down to $100,000 (note, you can still violate the daily
drawdown). For example, if you take your account to $170,000, as long as you do not drawdown more
than 5% in any given day, you would only breach if your account equity reaches $100,000.

Can I hold positions over the weekend?
We require all trades to be closed by 3:45pm EST on Friday. Any trades left open after this time will
automatically be closed. Note, this is only a soft breach and you will be able to continue trading once the
markets reopen.

What is 1 lot equal to on the Trading Platform?
● Forex: 1 lot = $100k notional

ONE STEP OVERVIEW

● Index: 1 lot = 1 Contract
Exceptions:
SPX500: 1 lot = 10 contracts

● Cryptos: 1 lot = 1 coin
● Silver: 1 lot = 5000 ounces
● Gold: 1 lot = 100 ounces
● Oil: 1 lot = 100 barrels

Is there a breach for inactivity?
Yes. We will consider you inactive and your account will be breached if you do not have any trading
activity on your account for 30 consecutive days.

FUNDED/LIVE ACCOUNTS | FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ):
How long does it take to receive my funded account?
Upon passing your Assessment, you will receive an email with instructions on how to access and
complete both your “Know Your Customer” verification and your “Trader Agreement”. Once both are
completed and supporting documentation is provided, your Funded Account will be created, funded and
issued to you typically within 24-48 business hours. You will receive a confirmation email once this
account is being enabled.
Once I pass the Assessment am I provided with a demo or funded account?
Once you pass the Assessment, we provide you with a funded account, backed by our capital. The
capital in your funded Account is notional and may not match the amount of capital on deposit with the
Liquidity Provider. A Funded Account is notionally funded when actual funds in the account (i.e., the
equity in a Funded Account represented by the amount of capital) differs from the nominal account size
(i.e., the size of the Funded Account that establishes the initial account value and level of trading).
Notional funds are the difference between nominal account size and actual capital in a Funded Account.
Use of notional funding does not impact your trading conditions in any way.
Do we manipulate the pricing or executions you receive in your funded account?
No. We do not have any control over pricing from the liquidity provider or on the executions on your
trades.
Who is the counterparty to my trades?
For purposes of managing risk and minimizing transaction costs, we may offset or negate market risk
and act as the direct counterparty to certain trades initiated in the Account. Such trades are executed at

ONE STEP OVERVIEW
April 2024

prices provided by arm’s length third parties. This framework is intended to ensure you receive real
market execution on your trades, while simultaneously allowing us to manage risk dynamically by
routing existing positions or future orders to third parties for execution as we deem appropriate. We

believe that such real market execution and dynamic risk management would not be possible or as cost-
effective if trades were executed in simulated accounts. Regardless of whether we act as counterparty

to your trades, the gain or loss on your funded account is not calculated differently. However, when we
act as the counterparty to your trades, there is an inherent potential conflict of interest because your
trades do not result in net gain or loss to us, as your trades would if we were not the direct
counterparty.
Am I subject to any position limits?
The maximum position that you may open is determined by your available margin. We reserve the right
to increase the margin requirement, limit the number of open positions you may enter or maintain in
the Funded Account at any time, and to revise in response to market conditions the drawdown levels at
which trading in the funded account will be halted. We or the Liquidity Provider reserve the right to
refuse to accept any order.
What are the rules for the funded account?
The rules for the funded account are exactly the same as your Assessment account. However, with a
funded account, there is no profit target.
If I have a hard breach in my funded account and there are gains in the account, do I forfeit those
gains?
If you have gains in your funded account at the time of a hard breach, you will still receive your portion
of those gains.
For example, if you have a $100,000 account and you grow that account to $110,000. Should you then
have a hard breach we would close the account. Of the $10,000 in gains in your funded account, you
would be paid your portion thereof.
How do I withdraw the gains in my funded account?
Traders can request a withdrawal of the gains in their funded account at any time in their trader
dashboard, but no more frequently than once per thirty (30) days. So, if you make gain in your funded
account, you can request a withdrawal. When you are ready to withdraw the gains from your funded
account, click the Withdraw Profits button in your trader dashboard and enter the amount to withdraw.
All such gains are distributed via the available outbound payment solutions offered from time to time.
Once your withdrawal request is approved, we will pay the monies owed to you. We reserve the right to
change the withdrawal methods and options at any time.
When can I withdraw the gains in my funded account and how does that affect my Maximum Trailing
Drawdown?
Your first withdrawal can be requested at any time. Thereafter, you can request a withdrawal of the
gains in your account every 30 days. When a withdrawal is approved, we will also withdraw our share of

ONE STEP OVERVIEW
April 2024

the gains, and your max trailing drawdown will lock in at your starting balance. The trailing drawdown
does not reset when you request a withdrawal. Example: You have taken an account from $100,000 to
$120,000. You then request a withdrawal of $16,000. In this scenario, you will receive $12,000 and we
would retain $4,000. This would also take the balance of the account down to $104,000, and your
Maximum Trailing Drawdown is locked in at $100,000. So, you would have $4,000 maximum you could
lose on the account before it would violate the Maximum Trailing Drawdown rule. If you take a full
withdrawal of the gains in your Funded Account, the Maximum Trailing Drawdown will still lock in at the
starting balance and will therefore result in the forfeiting of your Funded Account, as your balance will
trigger the Maximum Trailing Drawdown breach rule.
OTHER GENERAL QUESTIONS:
Do I have to use one of your accounts for the Assessment or can I use my own?
We have risk management software that is synced with the accounts we create. This allows us to
analyze your performance in real time for achievements or rule violations. As such, you must use an

TRADING RULES | FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ):
What is the difference between a Hard Breach and Soft Breach rule?

TWO STEP OVERVIEW
April 2024

● Soft breach means that we will close all trades that have violated the rule. However, you can continue
trading in your Assessment or Funded Account.
● Hard breach means that you violated either the Daily Loss Limit or Max Drawdown rule. Both rules
constitute a hard breach. In the event you have a hard breach, you will fail the Assessment or have your
Funded Account taken away.
How do you calculate the 4% Daily Loss Limit?
The Daily Loss Limit is the maximum your account can lose in any given day. Daily Loss Limit is calculated
using the previous day balance which resets at 5 PM EST. Daily Stop compounds with the increase in
your account.
Example: if your prior day's end of day balance (5pm EST) was $100,000, your account would violate the
daily stop loss limit if your equity reached $96,000 during the day. If your floating equity is +$6,000 on a
$100,000 account, your new- day (5pm EST) max loss is based on your balance from the previous day
($100,000). So, your daily loss limit would still be $96,000.
How do you calculate the 8% Max Drawdown?
Maximum drawdown is the maximum your account can drawdown before you would hard breach your
account. When you open the account, your Maximum Drawdown is set at 8% of your starting balance.
This 8% is static and does not trail.

Can I hold positions over the weekend?
Positions on crypto can be held over the weekend. We require all trades on other assets to be closed by
3:45pm EST on Friday. Any trades left open after this time will automatically be closed prior to market
closing. Note, this is only a soft breach and you will be able to continue trading once the markets
reopen.

• Hard breach means that you violated either the Daily Loss Limit or Max Drawdown rule. Both rules
constitute a hard breach. In the event you have a hard breach, you will fail the Assessment or have
your Funded Account taken away.
Is there a Daily Loss limit?
The three-step program does not have a daily loss.
How do you calculate the 5% Max Drawdown?
Maximum drawdown is the maximum your account can drawdown before you would hard breach your
account. When you open the account, your Maximum Drawdown is set at 5% of your starting balance.
This 5% is static and does not trail.

Can I hold positions over the weekend?
Positions on crypto can be held over the weekend. We require all trades on other assets to be closed by
3:45pm EST on Friday. Any trades left open after this time will automatically be closed prior to market
closing. Note, this is only a soft breach and you will be able to continue trading once the markets
reopen.
What is 1 lot equal to on the Trading Platform?
• Forex - 1 lot = $100k notional
• Index - 1 lot = 1 Contracts
• Exceptions:
• SPX500: 1 lot = 10 contracts
• JPN225: 1 lot = 500 contracts
• Cryptos - 1 lot = 1 coin
• Silver - 1 lot = 5000 ounces
• Gold - 1 lot = 100 ounces
• Oil - 1 lot = 100 barrels

Is there a breach for inactivity?
Yes. If you do not place a trade at least once every 30 days on your account, we will consider you
inactive and your account will be breached.
FUNDED ACCOUNTS | FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ):
How Long does it take to receive my Funded Account?

THREE STEP OVERVIEW
April 2024

Upon passing your Assessment, you will receive an email with instructions on how to access and
complete both your “Know Your Customer” verification and your “Trader Agreement”. Once both are
completed and supporting documentation is provided, your Funded Account will be created, funded and
issued to you typically within 24-48 business hours. You will receive a confirmation email once this
account is being enabled.
Once I pass the Assessment am I provided with a demo or funded account?
Once you pass the Assessment, we provide you with a funded account, backed by our capital.
The capital in your funded Account is notional and may not match the amount of capital on
deposit with the Liquidity Provider. A Funded Account is notionally funded when actual funds in
the account (i.e., the equity in a Funded Account represented by the amount of capital) differs
from the nominal account size (i.e., the size of the Funded Account that establishes the initial
account value and level of trading). Notional funds are the difference between nominal account
size and actual capital in a Funded Account.
Use of notional funding does not impact your trading conditions in any way.
Do we manipulate the pricing or executions you receive in your Funded Account?
No. We do not have any control over pricing from the liquidity provider or on the executions on
your trades.
Who is the counterparty to my trades?
For purposes of managing risk and minimizing transaction costs, we may offset or negate
market risk and act as the direct counterparty to certain trades initiated in the Account. Such
trades are executed at prices provided by arm’s length third parties. This framework is intended
to ensure you receive real market execution on your trades, while simultaneously allowing us to
manage risk dynamically by routing existing positions or future orders to third parties for
execution as we deem appropriate. We believe that such real market execution and dynamic
risk management would not be possible or as cost-effective if trades were executed in
simulated accounts. Regardless of whether we act as counterparty to your trades, the gain or
loss on your funded account is not calculated differently. However, when we act as the
counterparty to your trades, there is an inherent potential conflict of interest because your
trades do not result in net gain or loss to us, as your trades would if we were not the direct
counterparty.
Am I subject to any position limits?
The maximum position that you may open is determined by your available margin. We reserve the right
to increase the margin requirement, limit the number of open positions you may enter or maintain in
the Funded Account at any time, and to revise in response to market conditions the drawdown levels at
which trading in the funded account will be halted. We or the Liquidity Provider reserve the right to
refuse to accept any order.
What are the rules for the funded account?

THREE STEP OVERVIEW
April 2024

The rules for the funded account are exactly the same as your Assessment account. However, with a
funded account, there is no profit target.
If I have a hard breach in my funded account and there are gains in the account, do I forfeit those
gains?
If you have gains in your funded account at the time of a hard breach, you will still receive your portion
of those gains.
For example, if you have a $100,000 account and you grow that account to $110,000. Should you then
have a hard breach we would close the account. Of the $10,000 in gains in your funded account, you
would be paid your portion thereof.
How do I withdraw the gains in my funded account?
Traders can request a withdrawal of the gains in their funded account at any time in their trader
dashboard, but no more frequently than once per thirty (30) days. So, if you make gain in your funded
account, you can request a withdrawal. When you are ready to withdraw the gains from your funded
account, click the Withdraw Profits button in your trader dashboard and enter the amount to withdraw.
All such gains are distributed via the available outbound payment solutions offered from time to time.
Once your withdrawal request is approved, we will pay the monies owed to you. We reserve the right to
change the withdrawal methods and options at any time.
When can I withdraw the gains in my funded account and how does that affect my Maximum
Drawdown?
Your first withdrawal can be requested at any time. Thereafter, you can request a withdrawal of the gains
in your account every 30 days. When a withdrawal is approved, we will also withdraw our share of the
gains, and your max drawdown will lock in at your starting balance. The Maximum Drawdown does not
reset when you request a withdrawal. Example: You have taken an account from $100,000 to $120,000.
You then request a withdrawal of $16,000. In this scenario, you will receive $12,000 and we would retain
$4,000. This would also take the balance of the account down to $104,000, and your Maximum
Drawdown is locked in at $100,000. So, you would have $4,000 maximum you could lose on the account
before it would violate the Maximum Drawdown rule. If you take a full withdrawal of the gains in your
Funded Account, the Maximum Drawdown will still lock in at the starting balance and will therefore
result in the forfeiting of your Funded Account, as your balance will trigger the Maximum Drawdown
breach rule.
OTHER GENERAL QUESTIONS:
Do I have to use one of your accounts for the Assessment or can I use my own?
We have risk management software that is synced with the accounts we create. This allows us to
analyze your performance in real time for achievements or rule violations. As such, you must use an
account that we provide to you.

TRADING RULES | FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ):
What is the difference between a Hard Breach and Soft Breach rule?
 Soft breach means that we will close all trades that have violated the rule. However, you can continue trading in your
Instant Funded Account.
 Hard breach means that you violated the Daily Loss Limit or Max Drawdown rule, or Inactivity rule. These rules
constitute a hard breach. In the event you have a hard breach, you will have your Funded Account taken away.

INSTANT FUNDING OVERVIEW

March 2025

How do you calculate the Daily Loss Limit?
The Daily Loss Limit is the maximum amount your account can lose on any given day. The Daily Loss Limit is calculated using the
previous day balance which resets at 5 PM EST. The Daily Loss Limit compounds with the increase in your account. Example: if
your prior day&#39;s end of day balance (5pm EST) was $100,000, your account would violate the daily stop loss limit if your equity
reached $95,000 during the day. If your floating equity is +$5,000 on a $100,000 account, your new- day (5pm EST) daily loss is
based on your balance from the previous day ($100,000). So, your daily loss limit would still be $95,000.
How do you calculate the Maximum Trailing Drawdown?
The Maximum Trailing Drawdown is initially set at 8% and trails (using CLOSED BALANCE - NOT equity) your account until you
have achieved a 8% return in your account. Once you have achieved an 8% return, the Maximum Trailing Drawdown no longer
trails and is permanently locked in at your starting balance. Example: If your starting balance is $100,000, you can drawdown to
$92,000 before you would violate the Maximum Trailing Drawdown rule. Then for example let&#39;s say you take your account to
$102,000 in CLOSED BALANCE. This is your new high-water mark, which would mean your new Maximum Trailing Drawdown
would be $94,000. Next, let&#39;s say you take your account to $106,000 in CLOSED BALANCE, which would be your new high-water
mark. At this point your Maximum Trailing Drawdown would be locked in at your starting balance of $100,000. So, regardless of
how high your account goes, you would only breach this rule if your account drew back down to $100,000 (note, you could still
violate the daily drawdown). For example, if you take your account to $170,000, as long as you do not drawdown more than 5%
in any given day, you would only breach if your account equity reaches $100,000.
Can I hold positions over the weekend?
We require all trades to be closed by 3:45 PM EST on the last trading day of the week, typically Friday. However, in cases where
markets close early or are not open on a Friday, it is the trader’s responsibility to ensure all trades are closed before the weekend
based on the adjusted market schedule. Any trades left open after this time will be automatically closed. Note, this is considered
a soft breach, and you will be able to continue trading once the markets reopen.
What is 1 lot equal to on the Trading Platform?
● Forex - 1 lot = $100k notional
● Index: 1 lot = 1 Contract
Exceptions:
SPX500: 1 lot = 10 contracts
JPN225: 1 lot = 500 contracts
● Cryptos: 1 lot = 1 coin
● Silver: 1 lot = 5000 ounces
● Gold: 1 lot = 100 ounces
● Oil: 1 lot = 100 barrels
Is there a breach for inactivity?
Yes. If you do not place a trade at least once every 30 days on your account, we will consider you inactive and your account will
be breached.

INSTANT FUNDING ACCOUNTS | FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ):
What is the Instant Funding Plan?  
The Instant Funding Plan allows traders to start with a fully funded account without needing to complete an assessment phase.

INSTANT FUNDING OVERVIEW

March 2025
How Long does it take to receive my Instant Funded Account?
Upon completion of payment, we provide you with an Instant Funding account, backed by our capital. You will receive an email
with instructions on how to access this account on the platform you chose at checkout.
The capital in your Funded Account is notional and may not match the amount of capital on deposit with the Broker. A Funded
Account is notionally funded when actual funds in the account (i.e., the equity in a Funded Account represented by the amount
of capital) differs from the nominal account size (i.e., the size of the Funded Account that establishes the initial account value and
level of trading). Notional funds are the difference between nominal account size and actual capital in a Funded Account.
Use of notional funding does not change the trading level or that the account may trade in any manner differently than if
notional funds were not used. In particular, the same conditions and rules applicable to a soft breach, hard breach, Daily Loss
Limit, Max Trailing Drawdown and position limits apply.
Do I need to complete KYC or sign a trader contract to start trading in an Instant Funding Plan?  
A Trading contract and KYC are both required, however, to start trading using our Instant Funding Plan, these steps won’t need to
be completed until you request a withdrawal. 
What happens if I do not pass KYC?  
If you do not pass the KYC process when requesting a withdrawal, the withdrawal will be rejected, and your account will be
closed. We encourage you to ensure you can meet KYC requirements before opting for the Instant Funding Plan. 
Do we manipulate the pricing or executions you receive in your Instant Funded Account?
No. We operate at an arm&#39;s length with the Broker. All market pricing and trade executions are provided by the Broker and are
not changed or modified by us. Additionally, we do not markup transaction costs established by the Broker through adjusting bid-
offer spreads, markups/markdowns, commission charges or swaps.
Who is the counterparty to my trades?
For the purposes of managing risk and minimizing transaction costs, we may offset or negate market risk and act as the direct
counterparty to certain trades initiated in the Account. Such trades are executed at prices provided by the Broker. This
framework is intended to ensure you receive real market execution on your trades, while simultaneously allowing us to manage
risk dynamically by routing existing positions or future orders to third parties for execution as we deem appropriate. We believe
that such real market execution and dynamic risk management would not be possible or cost-effective if trades were executed in
simulated accounts. Regardless of whether we act as counterparty to your trades, the gain or loss on your Funded Account is not

requirement, limit the number of open positions you may enter or maintain in the Funded Account at any time, and to revise in
response to market conditions the drawdown levels at which trading in the funded account will be halted. We or the Liquidity
Provider reserve the right to refuse to accept any order.
If I have a hard breach in my Funded Account and there are gains in the account, do I forfeit those gains?
If you have gains in your Funded Account at the time of a hard breach, you will still receive your portion of those gains.

INSTANT FUNDING OVERVIEW

March 2025

For example, if you have a $100,000 account and you grow that account to $110,000. Should you then have a hard breach we
would close the account. Of the $10,000 in gains in your Funded Account, you would be paid your portion thereof.
How do I withdraw the gains in my Funded Account?
Traders can request a withdrawal of the profits in their funded account through their trader dashboard at any time. However,
withdrawals are limited to one request every 30 days. The minimum withdrawal amount is the greater of $100 or 1% of the
account&#39;s starting balance. When a withdrawal is approved, we will also withdraw our share of the gains, and your max trailing
drawdown will lock in at your starting balance. The trailing drawdown does not reset when you request a withdrawal. Example:
You have taken an account from $100,000 to $120,000. You then request a withdrawal of $16,000. In this scenario, you will
receive $12,800 and we would retain $3200. This would also take the balance of the account down to $104,000, and your
Maximum Trailing Drawdown is locked in at $100,000. So, you would have $4,000 maximum you could lose on the account
before it would violate the Maximum Trailing Drawdown rule. If you take a full withdrawal of the gains in your Funded Account,
the Maximum Trailing Drawdown will lock in at the starting balance and trigger the Maximum Trailing Drawdown breach rule,
resulting in the forfeiture of your Funded Account.

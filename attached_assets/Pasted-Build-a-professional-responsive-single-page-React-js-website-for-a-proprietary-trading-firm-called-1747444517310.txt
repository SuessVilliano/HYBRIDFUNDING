Build a professional, responsive, single-page React.js website for a proprietary trading firm called **Hybrid Funding**.

The site must include routing (React Router), Tailwind CSS for styling, and follow a cyberpunk visual theme using:
- Primary color: #8A2BE2 (Cyberpunk Purple)
- Accent color: #00FFFF (Aqua Blue)
- Dark background with neon-glow UI elements

This website should feel futuristic and premium — it must not look flat or generic.

### Understanding Notional Funding
```
Notional funding means that the capital in your funded account represents trading capacity rather than actual deposited cash. Here's how it works:

üíº What It Means:
‚Ä¢ The nominal account size (e.g., $100,000) establishes your trading level
‚Ä¢ The actual capital in the account may differ from this amount
‚Ä¢ You still trade as if the full amount is present

‚öñÔ∏è How It Works:
‚Ä¢ Your profit share is calculated based on actual trading gains
‚Ä¢ Risk parameters apply to the nominal account size
‚Ä¢ Trading conditions remain consistent regardless of notional funding

üîç Benefits:
‚Ä¢ Allows us to provide larger account sizes
‚Ä¢ Enables efficient capital allocation
‚Ä¢ Maintains real market execution while managing risk

This approach is standard in the prop trading industry and has no impact on your trading experience or profit potential.
```

### Understanding the Consistency Requirement (Futures)
```
The consistency requirement in our Futures program ensures disciplined trading by limiting how much of your profit can come from a single day. Here's how it works:

üìä Formula: (Best Day Profit √∑ Total Profit) √ó 100 ‚â§ 25%

üìù Example:
‚Ä¢ If you need $9,000 profit on a $100K account
‚Ä¢ With a 25% consistency requirement
‚Ä¢ Your best day cannot exceed $2,250 ($9,000 √ó 25%)
‚Ä¢ You need at least 4 days to hit target (100% √∑ 25%)

If your best day exceeds 25% of total profit:
‚Ä¢ You haven't failed the challenge
‚Ä¢ But you must continue trading to increase total profit
‚Ä¢ Example: If best day is $3,000, total profit needs to be $12,000

This rule prevents "lucky" one-day trades and rewards consistent performance.
```

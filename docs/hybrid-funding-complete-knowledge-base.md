## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**What is Hybrid Funding?**  
Hybrid Funding is a proprietary trading firm that provides capital to skilled traders. We offer evaluation programs across Forex, Crypto, and Futures markets to identify disciplined and profitable traders, then fund successful candidates with our capital and share the profits.

**How does your funding model work?**  
Our model consists of two main stages: an evaluation (challenge) phase and a funded phase. Traders first prove their skills by passing our evaluation challenge, then receive a funded account where they trade with our capital and keep a significant percentage of the profits. We also offer Instant Funding options for immediate trading access.

**What makes Hybrid Funding different from other prop firms?**  
We offer multiple challenge paths across three asset classes (Forex, Crypto, and Futures), each with flexible rules. Our Futures program features a unique four-phase structure with payouts at each milestone. We also offer higher leverage on crypto pairs (5:1 for BTC/ETH) and competitive profit splits up to 90%.

**Do I own the account after passing the challenge?**  
No. The account remains the property of Hybrid Funding. You are granted trading access and earn a percentage of the profits generated, but the capital belongs to our firm.

### Challenge Programs

**What challenge programs do you offer?**  
We offer four types of programs:
- One-Step: Single evaluation phase with higher profit targets
- Two-Step: Two consecutive phases with moderate targets
- Three-Step: Three phases with lower targets per phase
- Instant Funding: Immediate account access with no evaluation

**Which program is best for beginners?**  
The Three-Step program is most suitable for beginners as it has the lowest profit targets per phase (5%) and provides more time to achieve funding. The moderate drawdown limit (5%) also helps beginners learn risk management.

**Is there a time limit to complete the challenges?**  
Most of our programs don't have specific time limits. However, all accounts are subject to a 30-day inactivity rule, meaning you must place at least one trade every 30 days to avoid account termination.

**What happens if I fail a challenge?**  
If you fail a challenge by violating a hard breach rule (exceeding max drawdown, daily loss limit, or inactivity), you'll need to purchase a new challenge. There are no free retakes.

### Rule Breach Questions

**What happens to my profits if my funded account has a hard breach?**  
If your funded account is terminated due to a hard breach but had generated profits prior to the breach, you will still receive your share of those profits according to your profit-sharing agreement (typically 80-90%). The profit calculation is based on the final account balance at termination minus the initial account balance.

**Can I appeal a rule breach or account termination?**  
Appeals are generally not accepted for standard rule breaches as these are monitored and enforced by automated systems. The only exception is for proven technical malfunctions of the trading platform that directly caused the breach. Such appeals require substantial evidence and must be submitted within 24 hours of the breach.

**If my account is terminated due to inactivity, can I still withdraw profits?**  
Yes. If your funded account is terminated due to 30-day inactivity but had generated profits, you will still receive your share of those profits according to your profit-sharing agreement.

**If the market gaps and causes my account to breach the maximum drawdown, does that still count?**  
Yes. Risk management is a key component of our evaluation, and traders are expected to manage their positions to avoid significant losses even in gap scenarios. Market gaps that cause breaches are still considered valid breaches, and the standard termination policy applies.

### Trading Rules

**What are soft and hard breaches?**  
- Soft Breach: Results in position closure but allows continued trading (e.g., holding positions over the weekend without the add-on)
- Hard Breach: Results in account termination (e.g., exceeding max drawdown, daily loss limit, or 30-day inactivity)

**How is the maximum drawdown calculated?**  
The calculation depends on the program:
- Static Drawdown: Fixed percentage of starting balance that doesn't change (used in Three-Step program)
- Trailing Drawdown: Follows your account equity as it grows (used in Instant Funding and some Forex programs)

**What is the daily loss limit?**  
The daily loss limit is calculated based on your previous day's closing balance (at 5 PM EST). If your account drops below this limit during the trading day, it's considered a hard breach. The exact percentage varies by program (typically 4-5%).

**What is the consistency requirement for Futures trading?**  
The consistency requirement ensures disciplined trading by limiting your best day's profit to 25% of your total profit. This means you must trade at least 4 days to hit your target, preventing "lucky" single-day trades from passing the challenge.

### Funding & Withdrawals

**How long does it take to receive a funded account?**  
After passing your challenge, you'll need to complete KYC verification and sign the trader agreement. Once completed, you'll typically receive your funded account within 24-48 business hours.

**What is the profit split for funded accounts?**  
The standard profit split is 75-80% for traders (depending on the program). You can purchase a 90% profit split add-on during checkout for an additional 20% cost.

**How often can I withdraw profits?**  
You can request your first withdrawal anytime after generating profits. After that, withdrawals can be requested every 30 days. For Futures accounts, specific payouts occur at the completion of each phase.

**Is there a minimum withdrawal amount?**  
Yes, the minimum withdrawal is the greater of $100 or 1% of your account's starting balance.

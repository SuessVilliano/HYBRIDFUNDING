# Hybrid Funding Public FAQ

This document contains frequently asked questions and answers about Hybrid Funding's prop trading programs. This content can be used for the website FAQ section, support chatbot, or customer service responses.

## General Questions

### What is Hybrid Funding?
Hybrid Funding is a proprietary trading firm that provides capital to skilled traders. We offer evaluation programs across Forex, Crypto, and Futures markets to identify disciplined and profitable traders, then fund successful candidates with our capital and share the profits.

### How does your funding model work?
Our model consists of two main stages: an evaluation (challenge) phase and a funded phase. Traders first prove their skills by passing our evaluation challenge, then receive a funded account where they trade with our capital and keep a significant percentage of the profits. We also offer Instant Funding options for immediate trading access.

### What makes Hybrid Funding different from other prop firms?
We offer multiple challenge paths across three asset classes (Forex, Crypto, and Futures), each with flexible rules. Our Futures program features a unique four-phase structure with payouts at each milestone. We also offer higher leverage on crypto pairs (5:1 for BTC/ETH) and competitive profit splits up to 90%.

### Which countries do you accept traders from?
We accept traders from most countries worldwide. However, due to regulations, we cannot provide services to residents of countries under OFAC sanctions. Please check our Terms page for the complete list of restricted countries.

### Do I own the account after passing the challenge?
No. The account remains the property of Hybrid Funding. You are granted trading access and earn a percentage of the profits generated, but the capital belongs to our firm.

## Challenge Programs

### What challenge programs do you offer?
We offer four types of programs:
- One-Step: Single evaluation phase with higher profit targets
- Two-Step: Two consecutive phases with moderate targets
- Three-Step: Three phases with lower targets per phase
- Instant Funding: Immediate account access with no evaluation

### Which program is best for beginners?
The Three-Step program is most suitable for beginners as it has the lowest profit targets per phase (5%) and provides more time to achieve funding. The moderate drawdown limit (5%) also helps beginners learn risk management.

### Is there a time limit to complete the challenges?
Most of our programs don't have specific time limits. However, all accounts are subject to a 30-day inactivity rule, meaning you must place at least one trade every 30 days to avoid account termination.

### What happens if I fail a challenge?
If you fail a challenge by violating a hard breach rule (exceeding max drawdown, daily loss limit, or inactivity), you'll need to purchase a new challenge. There are no free retakes.

## Asset Classes

### What markets can I trade with Hybrid Funding?
We support three market categories:
1. Forex: Currency pairs with varying leverage options
2. Crypto: Cryptocurrency trading with specialized leverage
3. Futures: Indices, commodities, and financial futures through a four-phase program

### What's the difference between Forex, Crypto, and Futures programs?
Each asset class has specialized rules:
- Forex: Standard challenge structure with weekend trading restrictions
- Crypto: 24/7 trading allowed, with unique leverage ratios and daily cap limits
- Futures: Four-phase program with consistency requirements and payouts at each phase

### What leverage do you offer?
Leverage varies by asset class:
- Forex: 1:20 to 1:50 depending on program
- Crypto: 5:1 for BTC and ETH, 2:1 for other cryptocurrencies
- Futures: Standard leverage ratios for futures contracts with specific contract limits

### Can I trade over weekends?
Crypto positions can be held over weekends by default. For Forex, you must close positions by 3:45 PM EST on Friday unless you purchase the Weekend Hold add-on. Futures markets follow standard exchange hours and cannot be traded when markets are closed.

## Trading Rules

### What are soft and hard breaches?
- Soft Breach: Results in position closure but allows continued trading (e.g., holding positions over the weekend without the add-on)
- Hard Breach: Results in account termination (e.g., exceeding max drawdown, daily loss limit, or 30-day inactivity)

### How is the maximum drawdown calculated?
The calculation depends on the program:
- Static Drawdown: Fixed percentage of starting balance that doesn't change (used in Three-Step program)
- Trailing Drawdown: Follows your account equity as it grows (used in Instant Funding and some Forex programs)

### What is the daily loss limit?
The daily loss limit is calculated based on your previous day's closing balance (at 5 PM EST). If your account drops below this limit during the trading day, it's considered a hard breach. The exact percentage varies by program (typically 4-5%).

### What is the consistency requirement for Futures trading?
The consistency requirement ensures disciplined trading by limiting your best day's profit to 25% of your total profit. This means you must trade at least 4 days to hit your target, preventing "lucky" single-day trades from passing the challenge.

## Funding & Withdrawals

### How long does it take to receive a funded account?
After passing your challenge, you'll need to complete KYC verification and sign the trader agreement. Once completed, you'll typically receive your funded account within 24-48 business hours.

### What is the profit split for funded accounts?
The standard profit split is 75-80% for traders (depending on the program). You can purchase a 90% profit split add-on during checkout for an additional 20% cost.

### How often can I withdraw profits?
You can request your first withdrawal anytime after generating profits. After that, withdrawals can be requested every 30 days. For Futures accounts, specific payouts occur at the completion of each phase.

### Is there a minimum withdrawal amount?
Yes, the minimum withdrawal is the greater of $100 or 1% of your account's starting balance.

## Account Verification

### When do I need to complete KYC verification?
For standard challenge programs, you must complete KYC verification before receiving your funded account. For Instant Funding, you can begin trading immediately but must complete KYC before requesting any withdrawals.

### What documents are required for verification?
You'll need to provide:
- Government-issued ID (passport, driver's license)
- Proof of address (utility bill, bank statement from the last 3 months)
- Additional documentation may be required based on your jurisdiction

### What happens if I fail the verification process?
If you fail verification after passing a standard challenge, a funded account will not be issued. For Instant Funding, if verification fails when requesting a withdrawal, the withdrawal will be rejected and the account may be closed.

## Platform & Technology

### What trading platforms do you support?
We support DXtrade, MatchTrader, and cTrader platforms. Our technology integrates with these platforms to monitor your trading performance in real-time.

### Are trading algorithms or EAs allowed?
Yes, automated trading is allowed on our platforms. However, the specific rules vary by asset class and program. Crypto accounts generally allow EAs, while some restrictions may apply to other asset classes.

### Do I need to pay for market data?
Market data fees are included during evaluation phases. For Futures trading after reaching the Live Funded stage, you become responsible for platform and data fees, which are deducted monthly from your account balance.

## Add-ons & Pricing

### What add-ons do you offer?
We offer two primary add-ons:
- Weekend Hold (10% additional cost): Allows holding Forex positions over weekends
- 90% Profit Split (20% additional cost): Increases your profit share to 90% in funded accounts

### Are there any recurring fees?
No, all challenge purchases are one-time fees with no recurring costs. For Futures traders who reach the Live Funded stage, platform and data fees will apply, deducted from account balance.

### Do you offer refunds?
No refunds are offered once trading has begun. In cases of technical issues not caused by the trader, we may issue a replacement account at our discretion.
